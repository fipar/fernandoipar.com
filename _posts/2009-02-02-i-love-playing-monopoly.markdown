<p><a href="http://www.speedtest.net/result/402451392.png">This is the latest speed test I run against Santiago de Chile</a>, where a lonely database server is waiting for my queries. Well, it's got a lot of waiting to do.</p>
<p>This results are from a 2048 down /256 up Kb/s connection for which I pay U$S 52/monthly.<br />
Yeah, I feel your envy already.</p>
<p>The Administraci√≥n Nacional de Telecomunicaciones of Uruguay runs my ISP. I could choose another one, but the link to the outside world would eventually be handled by the state.</p>
<p>I called tech support twice this week, and it seems this results are due to a problem with the international (I get real fast to anything in Uruguay or Argentina, I guess it's my fault for getting customers outside of that comfort zone!) link. They don't have an estimated date of repair, and they don't need to, since, what else I'm I going to do? Probably take a plane and sit on a console in front of the damn database.</p>
