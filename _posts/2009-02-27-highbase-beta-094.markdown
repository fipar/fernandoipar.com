<p>Heavy testing, headphones with no music, lots of <a title="Sanchez Gran Reserva : Costa Rican Coffee" href="http://www.costaricacoffeeshop.com/shopexd.asp?id=10" target="_blank">Sanchez Gran Reserva</a>, headphones with Miles Davis, more testing, an updated <a title="Highbase : Installation guide" href="http://highbase.seriema-systems.com/staticpages/index.php?page=20080615InstallGuide" target="_blank">Installation Guide</a>, Charles Mingus &amp; Eric Dolphy, and I still couldn't get a Release Candidate out.</p>
<p>Well, such is the life of the multi purpose hacker. Other people are always finding out new purposes for you, which makes your free time aproach zero.</p>
<p>Does this mean that the release date of rc-1 will never come? Nah, I don't think so. I have high hopes for the next iteration.</p>
<p>Wanna help me? Please test the installation guide, and then test the cluster itself. There's a contact mail in the guide (yep, I don't fear spam, I love it, it's great for art).</p>
<p>Thanks to the 5000+ anonymous folks who bothered to download this, and thanks to all the people who contributed patches throughout these years.</p>
