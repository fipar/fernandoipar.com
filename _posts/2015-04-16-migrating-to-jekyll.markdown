After years of service, my wordpress installation was compromised sometime last week, with all php files replaced by a link to some external site. 
I estimate losses on my part to about $.01, but the impact on my reputation may be more difficult to quantify! 

I was meaning to migrate to some static site generator based workload, since I don't have time to be up to date on wordpress updates, security patches, etc, and I guess this provided the ideal opportunity. 

Most posts are back online, with redirects to maintain the original urls, and I'm in the process of importing comments into disqus (so none are showing at the time of writing this). 

Not that much people care, but I expect to be back to normal in a few days, including recovering all comments.

Thanks.
