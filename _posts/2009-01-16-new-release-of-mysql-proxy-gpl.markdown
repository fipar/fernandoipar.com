<p><a title="MySQL Proxy" href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-proxy/index.html" target="_self">MySQL Proxy</a> has a new release, just three days ago, and if that wasn't good enough, it's now hosted on <a title="MySQL Proxy at Launchpad" href="https://launchpad.net/mysql-proxy">Launchpad</a>, so it's repository is on bazaar, which is great, and is what I've been using for my new projects.</p>
