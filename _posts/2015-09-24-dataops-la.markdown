Next November I'll once again take the ferry to my neighbour city of Buenos Aires to enjoy two days of learning, networking, and presenting, at [DataOps LA 2015](http://www.dataops.la/), the first incarnation of what used to be the [MySQL, NoSQL, Cloud](http://mysqlnosqlcloud.com/) Conference organized by [BinLogic](http://binlogic.com/) in Buenos Aires. 

The change in name reflects a change in scope, now including Operations, Infrastructure and Development tracks, besides the familiar Database one (with lots of MySQL content, but other systems covered too!). 

The agenda is not yet confirmed and, in fact, the [Call for Papers](http://www.dataops.la/callforpapers.php) is open, so if you want and can afford to go, I encourage you to submit proposals. Of course, if you also want and can afford to sponsor, there are [a few plans](http://www.dataops.la/sponsors.php) available, and I would encourage you to do so too. I am personally very happy that, once again, Percona is supporting this project this year. 

I'm looking forward to seeing old friends and making new ones in this wide (and growing) community we have!
