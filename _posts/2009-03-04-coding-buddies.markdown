<p><a title="Coding Horror" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Coding Horror</a> always has insightfull articles, and this one on <a title="Who's your coding buddy?" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001229.html">code peer reviews</a> is no exception.</p>
<p>Why is it that writers, musicians and, well, any respected and professional artist or scientist gets his/her work reviewed before it's published, but the same isn't true in IT?</p>
<p>My guess? Most programmers aren't neither artists, nor scientists. They're an anonymous resource in a badly oiled machine that's always behind schedule.</p>
<p>Well, so long, Knuth!</p>
