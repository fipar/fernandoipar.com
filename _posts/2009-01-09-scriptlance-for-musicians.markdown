<p>I don't know if this will work or not, but at least it shows that people are always coming up with new and interesting ideas. The folks over at <a title="Minimum Noise's Projects" href="http://www.minimumnoise.com/Projects.aspx" target="_blank">Minimum Noise</a> have created a collaboration site for musicians, where one can either seek help to complete a music project, or get paid for producing/mixing, singing, or playing an instrument.</p>
<p>So far, I believe the monetary rewards are probably too small, but if people do this in their spare time maybe this could take off anyway.</p>
<p>It's still cool :)</p>
