<p>Yep, I'm really late for this.</p>
<p>However, I didn't want to let it pass. I checked up on erlybird a couple of times before, but it was only available as a source project, and you needed a particular netbeans version in order to build the module.</p>
<p>I'm as geek as it gets, but I'm also 30, married, and a parent. I would have done that 12 years ago, now ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install is as far as I take it unless I'm really into it.</p>
<p>So 0.17.0 (released last November) fixes all this, it's a netbeans module, which you can install the usual way. It requires NetBeans 6.5, but that's not an issue for me since I've been using that version for quite a while already.</p>

<p>Kudos to both admins for the great job they've done.</p>
