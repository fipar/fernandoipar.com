I currently work as Data Team Lead at 
[Perceptyx](https://www.perceptyx.com). 
Before that, I worked as a Principal Consultant at [Pythian](https://www.pythian.com) for 3 years, many roles at
[Percona](https://www.percona.com) for 7 years, and as a freelancer and small business owner for almost 10.
I'm also an amateur musician, and a very happy husband and dad.

You can contact me at [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/fipar)

Please note that is the **only** social network I use. I am not on
twitter or facebook, though you'll find people there with my same name
and on at least one case, from my same country (Uruguay). You'd be
confused if you follow them expecting to get updates from me.

I am on Google+ but I only use it to share pictures with family members. 

I've been involved in the Open Source community as a user since 1997,
and as programmer since 2002, contributing to a few projects, and leading some of my own.
