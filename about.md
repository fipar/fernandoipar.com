I work as a Consultant at [Percona](http://percona.com).
I'm also an amateur musician, and a very happy husband and dad.

You can contact me at [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/fipar)

I've been involved in the Open Soure community as a user since 1997,
and as programmer since 2002, contributing to a few projects, and leading some of my own.

This place is where I blog about software engineering, art, music, and anything I feel like.
