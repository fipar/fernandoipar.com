I work as a Consultant at [Percona](https://www.percona.com/about-us/our-team/fernando-ipar).
I'm also an amateur musician, and a very happy husband and dad.

You can contact me at [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/fipar)

Please note that is the **only** social network I use. I am not on
twitter or facebook, though you'll find people there with my same name
and on at least one case, from my same country (Uruguay). You'd be
confused if you follow them expecting to get updates from me.

I am on Google+ but I only use it to share pictures with family members. 

I've been involved in the Open Soure community as a user since 1997,
and as programmer since 2002, contributing to a few projects, and leading some of my own.

* [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/users/fipar/) (this is no
  longer maintained, only here for the sake of completeness)

This place is where I blog about software engineering, art, music, and anything I feel like.
